# üìò Data Structures & Algorithms in Java ‚Äî Ashesi Exam Solutions

This repository contains my Java implementations for 12 core data structures and algorithmic problems, inspired by real-world scenarios by Ashesi University. Each solution demonstrates key concepts in data structures, algorithm design, and performance analysis.

## ‚úÖ Covered Topics

### 1. **Array-Based List**

Custom dynamic array implementation supporting:

* `ADD`, `INSERT`, `REMOVE`, `GET`, `SIZE`, and `PRINT` operations.
* Automatic resizing (doubling capacity) with resize count tracking.

### 2. **Singly Linked List**

Custom singly linked list to manage waitlists:

* Supports `ADD_FRONT`, `ADD_END`, `ADD_AT`, `REMOVE`, `FIND`, `DISPLAY`, `REVERSE`.
* Traversal counter for `FIND` and `REMOVE` operations.

### 3. **Doubly Linked List**

Playlist manager with bidirectional traversal:

* `ADD_FIRST`, `ADD_LAST`, `ADD_AFTER`, `REMOVE`, `FIND`, `DISPLAY_FORWARD`, `DISPLAY_BACKWARD`.
* Tracks pointer updates (next/prev).

### 4. **Stack ‚Äì Infix to Postfix & Evaluation**

Command-line calculator:

* Converts infix expressions to postfix.
* Evaluates postfix expressions.
* Counts `push`/`pop` operations for both phases.

### 5. **Circular Queue**

Cafeteria order processing using a circular buffer:

* Implements `ENQUEUE`, `DEQUEUE`, `PEEK`, `SIZE`, and `PRINT`.
* Dynamically resizes and counts number of resizes.

### 6. **Binary Search (Iterative & Recursive)**

Alumni record lookup:

* Implements and compares iterative vs. recursive binary search.
* Tracks comparison counts for both versions.

### 7. **Insertion Sort vs. Selection Sort**

Ranking grant proposals by priority:

* Custom implementations for both sorts.
* Tracks comparisons, shifts (Insertion), swaps (Selection).
* Compares efficiency in nearly sorted and random datasets.

### 8. **Merge Sort**

Exam ranking system:

* Stable `mergeSort()` in `O(n log n)` time.
* Tracks number of comparisons.
* Preserves order for students with the same grade.

### 9. **Quick Sort**

Bookstore inventory sorted by price:

* In-place quick sort using last-element pivot.
* Tracks comparisons and swaps.
* Efficient space usage.

### 10. **Hash Table (Separate Chaining)**

Student information system:

* Custom hash table with separate chaining.
* Supports `PUT`, `GET`, `REMOVE`, `SIZE`, `DISPLAY`.
* Tracks collisions and rehashes.

### 11. **Binary Search Tree**

Phone directory using unbalanced BST:

* Implements `INSERT`, `SEARCH`, `DELETE`, `DISPLAY`.
* Uses in-order traversal.
* Tracks string comparisons.

### 12. **Graph Traversal (DFS & BFS)**

Campus navigation system:

* Uses adjacency list to represent graph.
* Implements `DFS` and `BFS` starting from given nodes.
* Tracks nodes visited and edges examined.

Each module includes:

* Problem description
* Java implementation
* Test cases with input/output
* Metrics (comparisons, swaps, shifts, traversals, etc.)

---

## üß™ Test Cases

Each solution is tested with at least **two test cases**:

* Full input and expected output
* Actual output
* Performance metrics (e.g., resize count, traversal count)

---

## üó£Ô∏è Oral Discussion Prep

For each problem, I‚Äôve prepared responses to:

* Time and space complexities
* Trade-offs of data structure choices
* Performance behavior under different input conditions

---

## üí° Why This Repo?

This project serves as a hands-on reinforcement of:

* Custom data structure implementation
* Efficient algorithm design
* Memory and performance trade-offs
* Real-world application of theoretical CS concepts

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

* Java 17
* CLI-based I/O
* No use of built-in collections (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc.)
